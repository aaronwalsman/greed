# Greed
A gambling game.  This is a new idea for a game, not even quite roughed out yet, but something about it is quite satisfying.

Players have a number of coins/chips with different sizes and shapes.  As with Princess Palanquin, some of these are indistinguishable from each other on one side, but the other side reveals some information about how much the chip is worth and possibly how "strong" it is.  It's possible that the two sides have two different values on them, and then when revealing stuff later, the higher value is chosen or something?  But I think it's simpler if it's just that one side makes the chip indistinguishable from others in the same class, and the other side has more specific information when revealed.

Really I just want to make coins and chips and plates with lots of different sizes and shapes.

How do you play this thing?  Some kind of wager system.  First everybody has to ante something.  Then people take turns adding to the pot.  At some point they stop.  Then everything is revealed, and whoever's contribution is strongest gets the goods.  How does this prevent one person from establishing a slight edge and then outbidding everybody for all time?  I have no clue.  I want the rules to be extremely simple though.  No nonsense.

I also want to say that I really really like the idea of this game come with a fixed set of chips.  I want there to be all kinds of wild chips out there in the universe that are the personal property of various individuals, and then when they come to sit down to play, they bring their personal stash and gamble with it.  This is kind of like deckbuilding in MTG, but with these weird poker chips instead.
